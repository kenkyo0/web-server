# web-server

---

### description:
This is a web-server completely build in c and ultra lightweight.
Because there is a wide bandwidth on functionality you can implement, this server isn't really done yet.

At the moment the server is possible to work with POST and GET requests, parse http and parse query strings.
... so also sending browser known languages like html, css and javascript

### current workstation
The next goal is to build this server around a dashboard, which i will code myself with a static website.
This dashboard should give information about cyber-security related and importand data, such as the ip-addresses
of your local network devices, state of the network (maybe also some stats of your own lab, if i'll be able to implement a flexible solution)
and whatever the time gives.
